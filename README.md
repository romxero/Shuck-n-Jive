# Shuck-n-Jive


Shuck-n-Jive is a bleeding edge static page and blog building system designed for DataHotep.

It aims to be highly flexible, fast, with a penchant for using minute amount of space, with most processing occuring on the client end than on the server.

It does this by utilizing current metadata techniques, json-ld tags in pages, zstd compression, and smart indexing.
